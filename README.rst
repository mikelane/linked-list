# Python Implementations of Various Linked Lists

I decided to take on the project of implementing my version of various types of linked lists. The goal here is to use best practices with regards to OOP, pythonic coding, and Test Driven Development. The hope is that this is a decent example for those looking for linked list implementations as well as OOP and testing in python.
